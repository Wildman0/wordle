# wordle
A clone of [powerlanguage](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/)'s daily word game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/), for the terminal. It uses the same daily word as the original website, so you can only play it once a day!

Once you have cabal installed, clone this repo and run:

You can also run wordle without installing it with:
